🔍 Phishing Indicators Identified

1. Spoofed Sender Email

The displayed sender name did not match the underlying email address.

The domain contained small variations that indicate spoofing.


2. Urgent or Threatening Language

Messages like “Your account will be locked in 24 hours” were used to create panic.

Classic social engineering mechanism to force quick action.


3. Suspicious / Mismatched URLs

When hovering over the “Verify Now” button, the actual link redirected to an unknown third-party website.

This mismatch is a major red flag.


4. Poor Grammar and Formatting

Multiple spelling mistakes and unnatural sentence structures.

Legitimate companies rarely send poorly written emails.


5. Generic Greetings

Instead of addressing the user personally, it used “Dear User”.

Indicates a mass-targeted phishing campaign.


6. Fake Security Warning

Generic claims of “verification failure” without specifying the platform.

Creates fear to push the victim into clicking.


7. Attachment / Link Requesting Login Credentials

The email insisted on clicking a link rather than logging in through the official website.

High-risk behavior typical of credential-harvesting attacks.


8. Email Header Analysis Findings

Using an online header analyzer:

Reply-To address differed from the real sender.

IP address did not belong to the company’s legitimate servers.

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks failed, showing it was not an authenticated email.
